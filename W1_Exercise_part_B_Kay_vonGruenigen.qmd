## Task

Create an HTML document with R code that samples 100 values from a negative binomial distribution (say, mu=10, dispersion=2; using the parameterisation with mean=mu and variance=mu+mu\^2\*dispersion); create a histogram of sampled data on both the linear and log \[or maybe log(x+1) due to zeros\] scale; Write 1-2 sentences to describe your steps (ideally also with section headings) and report the mean and variance of the sample in line in the text.

## Solution

Sample 100 values from given distribution:

```{r}
x_values <- rnbinom(100, size = 2, mu = 10)
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(x_values)
hist(log(x_values))

```

The mean is of the sample is:

```{r}
mean(x_values)

```

with a variance of:

```{r}
var(x_values)
```
